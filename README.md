# EventDisplay
Simple event display scripts for SUEPs analysis

## Getting started
Clone the repository and create a directory for saving the figures
```bash
mkdir Results
```

# Running the event display script
The event display script is `scripts/eventDisplay.py`.
Most likely you will only need to edit the input section to get the code running.
